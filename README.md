## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ialimeva Randrianasolo, a student at AthenÃ©e Saint Joseph Antsirabe studying Computer Science. I'm passionate about technology and software development, with particular interests in design, mobile apps and game developpement.
I'm currently pursuing my license degree in Software Engeneering, where I've been developing skills in Python, JavaScript,
Django, Tailwind CSS and React Native.

My technical interests include:
 - Building practical UI/UX designs that prioritize the user
 - Exploring game developpement and game AI
 - Mobile app development

Beyond coding, I'm also interested in:
 - 3D modeling
 - Drawing
 - Japanese Animations
 - Gaming
As a student developer, I believe GitHub Copilot would significantly enhance my learning journey by:
 - Helping me understand best coding practices
 - Allowing me to focus on problem-solving rather than syntax
 - Accelerating my learning of new languages and frameworks
 - Supporting my academic projects with intelligent code suggestions

After completing my studies, I aim to be as polyvalent as possible and have many carreer opportunities in different programming fields. Access to professional development tools like GitHub Copilot will help prepare me for these future endeavors.
